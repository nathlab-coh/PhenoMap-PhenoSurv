Description: Interpreting the functional impact of somatic mutations and 
    copy number alterations remains a major barrier in cancer genomics. 
    While RNA-based tools like `GSVA` offer pathway-level insights, 
    they are often impractical in clinical settings due to limited 
    transcriptomic data. To address this, we developed `PhenoMapper`, 
    trained to infer `GSVA`-like pathway activity scores from mutation 
    and copy number alteration data. By linking mutations and copy number 
    changes to biologically meaningful pathways, `PhenoMapper` enables 
    interpretable, scalable analysis of tumor biology using widely available 
    genomic data. All models are based on GSEA gene sets available through 
    MSigDB 
    (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/genesets.jsp?collection=H).
    This package uses models pretrained on TCGA pan-cancer data
    to predict single sample pathway scores with single nucleotide variants
    and copy number alterations.
